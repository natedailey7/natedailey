    <p>
      During spring 2022, I was in a game engine programming class at Pomona College. Most game design takes place
      in pre-built engines, which deal with low-level details such as basic physics, lighting, collisions, etc. (such as the Unity
      or Unreal engines). However, in this class we were assigned to create a 2d-graphics engine and game, and a 3d game based on
      the bare-bones Frenderer engine (created by Professor Joseph Osborn). Both games were created in teams of 3, and we had a lot of fun
      putting them together. Following are samples of both games: <b>Triumvirate Arena</b> and <b>JumpyBall</b>!
    </p>

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Triumvirate Arena</h2>
    <p>
        Triumvirate Arena is a battle card game featuring three players: Nate, Chloe, and Grace. Each player type has three
        signature moves which might increase or decrease your health/mana, and/or do damage to the other player. The goal of
        this two player game is to reduce the opponent to zero health.
    </p><p>
        We wrote Triumvirate Arena in Rust. And we did it from scratch, without a pre-made game engine. In our team of 3 (myself, Chloe,
        and Grace), I worked on gameflow mechanics (health/mana interactions, turn taking), player moves, and creating original music,
        while my partners worked on other various mechanics and graphics.

    <h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">JumpyBall</h2>

    <p>
        JumpyBall is a 3D parkour game. The player navigates through levels by jumping across platforms, avoiding the ground,
        and working their way to the end gem.
    </p><p>
        While Triumvirate Arena was created from scratch, JumpyBall was created with the help of the Frender game engine (created
        by Professor Joseph Osborn), which assisted with the 3D rendering. We were left to create the physics, collision system, 
        assets, and more. 
    </p><p>
        In JumpyBall, I primarily worked on asset creation and the collision system. I created all of the 3D models in Blender 
        and also wrote a Python script in Blender to determine the bounding boxes for each object (the core of our collision system).
